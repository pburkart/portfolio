			<p>This page is meant to serve as an introduction to who I am as a software developer. I have a wide range of interests covering all aspects of technology from Web Development to Embedded Systems.</p>
			<p>I will be attending college in September 2020 in order to earn my degree as a Computer Programmer / Analyst. I hope to then turn this into an advanced degree after spending a third year in Tralee, Ireland. From here, I haven't decided yet what path to take with my career. </p>

			<h2> Tell Me More</h2>

			<p>I have been studying computer programming in my time since I was 12. It all started when I made a calculator in VB.NET, following an online tutorial. This served as an excellent starting point as it introduced me to all of the concepts used in computer programming. Input/Output, Control Flow, Error Handling, Math. From here, I went on to study a great range of topics, including web development, game development, and database management. Lately I have been focused primarily on web development, and honing my JavaScript skills. Here are my top 3 skills as of 2020: </p>

			<h2>Top 3 Skills</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Python</li>
				<li>JavaScript</li>
				<li>CSS3</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Over the next 5 years I hope to become better at responsive web design and reactive web design with javascript. Beyond that, I also hope to expand my knowledge into the .NET architecture, and learn how to develop efficient clean desktop applications. Additionally, I would also like to start studying NodeJS, and use it in my desktop applications.</p>
